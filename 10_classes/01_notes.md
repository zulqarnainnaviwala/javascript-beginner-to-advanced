# javascript and classes

## Do JavaScript really have classes ?
JavaScript does have classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6). However, it's important to understand that JavaScript's classes are syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model rather than a new object-oriented inheritance model like in some other languages. Under the hood, JavaScript's classes are still based on prototypes.
